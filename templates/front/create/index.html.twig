        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-10 mt-20">Create Unique Builds</h2>
        <p class="leading-loose">Have you found a game-changing build? Or maybe a combination of runes and items that elevates your champion? On Legendarift, you can bring your ideas to life and share them with thousands of other players. <br> Each build is more than just a list of items: it's a playstyle, a philosophy that can inspire other summoners. Whether you're aiming to dominate your lane, surprise your opponents with unexpected strategies, or fine-tune a build for the current meta, the community is ready to embrace your creations and put them to the test in-game.</p>
